# Vux

Welcome to Vux!

Vux helps you create beautiful Python-based web apps without additional configurations, and provides a clean API for developers.
You can use Vux to create Markdown documentations or build a demo for your ML (machine-learning) models like [Gradio](https://gradio.app). (But seriously, we aren't that good enough.)

Key features:
- Simple: quick starts need to be fast!
- Async-ready: supported by Uvicorn
- Flexible: very bendable
- Fast: ⚡⚡

```shell
$ pip install vux
```
